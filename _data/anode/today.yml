  summary: "<ul>\n  <li><strong>요약(로컬):</strong> It is shown that continuously occurring\
    \ electrolyte-reduction reaction on freshly-exposed electrode surfaces during\
    \ lithiation/delithiation cycles causes the lowering of cycling efficiency, and\
    \ hence, capacity fade in well-cycled silicon anodes in lithium-ion batteries.\
    \ Using galvanostatic lithiation/delithiation data from multiple cycles on a Li/Si\
    \ half-cell, a methodology to separate the charge ...</li>\n</ul>"

  summary: "<ul>\n  <li><strong>요약(로컬):</strong> The existence of passivating layers\
    \ at the interfaces is a major factor enabling modern lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries.\
    \ Their properties determine the cycle life, performance, and safety of batteries.\
    \ A special case is the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), a heterogeneous multi-component\
    \ film formed due to the instability and subsequent decomposition of the electrolyte\
    \ at the surface of the anod...</li>\n</ul>"

  summary: "<ul>\n  <li><strong>요약(로컬):</strong> Two-dimensional (2D) carbon allotropes\
    \ have attracted growing interest for their structural versatility and potential\
    \ in energy storage and nanoelectronics. We propose Athos-Graphene (AG), a novel\
    \ 2D carbon allotrope inspired by the geometric patterns of Brazilian artist Athos\
    \ Bulcão. Designed using density functional theory, AG features a periodic structure\
    \ with high thermodynamic and thermal sta...</li>\n</ul>"
