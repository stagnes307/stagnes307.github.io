  summary: "<ul>\n  <li><strong>요약(로컬):</strong> The rapid evolution of quantum computing\
    \ hardware opens up new avenues in the simulation of energy materials. Today's\
    \ quantum annealers are able to tackle complex combinatorial optimization problems.\
    \ A formidable challenge of this type is posed by materials with site-occupational\
    \ disorder for which atomic arrangements with a low, or lowest, energy must be\
    \ found. In this article, a method is presen...</li>\n</ul>"

  summary: "<ul>\n  <li><strong>요약(로컬):</strong> Microstructure often dictates materials\
    \ performance, yet it is rarely treated as an explicit design variable because\
    \ microstructure is hard to quantify, predict, and optimize. Here, we introduce\
    \ an image centric, closed-loop framework that makes microstructural morphology\
    \ into a controllable objective and demonstrate its use case with Li- and Mn-rich\
    \ layered oxide cathode precursors. This work pre...</li>\n</ul>"

  summary: "<ul>\n  <li><strong>요약(로컬):</strong> A stochastic 3D modeling approach\
    \ for the nanoporous binder-conductive additive phase in hierarchically structured\
    \ cathodes of lithium-ion batteries is presented. The binder-conductive additive\
    \ phase of these electrodes consists of carbon black, polyvinylidene difluoride\
